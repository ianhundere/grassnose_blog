<p>
    i have always struggled to work fast in my creative musings, something
    always eating at me to "make it better." rarely do my changes effect the
    whole especially in regards to the time spent and what comes out on the
    other side. the time improving it would often be better spent starting
    something completely new.
</p>

<p>
    the time i struggle with this the most is towards the end of finishing
    a song, and often, working quickly staves off the worries allowing the song
    to point me in the direction it wants to go so as to put my "stamp" of
    completion on it.
</p>

<p>
    this helps me avoid the traps of "maybe i could have done this" or
    "maybe i should do that" that so often lead to aimless progress getting me
    to the incredibly stage listening,
    reflecting and hopefully, learning.

<h2 class="section-heading">a familar / quick workflow</h2>
<p>
    back in 2007, i stumbled onto <a
        href="https://monome.org/">monome</a> and
    purchased one of their first products, <a
        href="https://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/62/monome-40h/">the 40h</a>, and i
    began using it with something called mlr which essentially maps an audio
    sample across multiple leds allowing you to play samples in an improvisional
    way.

<p>
    monome created <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid/editions/"> number of
        iterations</a> many of which i owned (mutiple times over) from the 128
    all the way up to the 256.

<p>
    this monome/mlr way of working is something i've come back to many times
    primarily to play my songs in an improvisional way, and the reason(s) i
    often moved away from it was to:

    - focus on creating new songs
    - try to use my (more obtuse) gear to play improvisionally/live

    as much as i enjoy playing with my gear, the process/workflow is more akin
    to painting than playing realtime. so here i am, something like my 5th-6th
    time owning a monome grid to:

    - provide a workflow for playing live
    - something different from my typical paint brushes (gear)

    and more than anything, it allows me to quickly sit down and just jam
    without having to worry about so many variables. the only thing different is
    that i went down a rabbit hole of making setup as self sufficient as
    possible.

</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">improving upon a successful formula</h2>
<p>
    when the first monome grids came out they relied on <a
        href="https://cycling74.com/products/max">max/msp</a>, a visually
    oriented programming environment for audio and multimedia production, to
    play the variety of scripts for music making etc.
</p>

<p>
    now there's the <a
        href="https://monome.org/docs/norns/">norns</a>, a small, portable,
    open-source sound computer that dynamically runs scripts and DSP. so now the
    grid no longer required a computer to use. i did try the norns when it was
    released back in 2019, but the ecosystem was not quite mature and did not
    have the programming chops to contribute to it.
</p>

<p>
    fast forward a few years later, and i'm settled into a completetly different
    field, one that complements the technicality of the norns. i opted to build
    a rework/remix of the <a
        href="https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/">norns shield</a> called a
    <a
        href="https://github.com/okyeron/shieldXL">shieldXL</a>.

<h2 class="section-heading">more building</h2>
the shieldXL wasn't my only diy project for this revamp of a familar workflow, i
also built a midi controller, <a
    href="https://github.com/markwheeler/midi-mixer-one/">the midi mixer one</a>
to allow further immediate control of things.

</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">long story short</h2>

<p>
    after building the shieldXL and midi mixer one i knew i would want to have a
    capable stereo effects unit for the shieldXL's output. after a lot of back
    and forth from gear like the panasonic efx-1000, the panasonic rmx-1000, and
    the eventide h90, eventually settling on the elektron analog heat +fx, with
    the entire setup comprising of the following:
    <ul>
        <li><a
                href="https://monome.org/docs/grid/editions"><u>2021 monome 128

        <ul>
            <li>running an extended version of <a

</p>

<p>
    i spent a bit of time grabbing old bounced samples i had used with mlr in
    the past and prepped them to use with mlre. i'm still tweaking how i will
    use all the keys on the midi mixer one, but all-in-all, everything is
    working. i am in chats with the creator of mlre to see what features will be
    included in v2 of mlre, things such as quick recall of presets and the
    ability to not save certain parameters (e.g. one uses via a controller). all
    that is needed now is to practice and begin bouncing down new samps from
    songs i've done recently.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">other changes</h2>

    "flexible effects"

<p>
    i also spent time extending the use of my patchbay so that all
    effect ins/outs can be utilized since i only have 6 in / 6 out allowing the
    analog heat to be used across my setup.
