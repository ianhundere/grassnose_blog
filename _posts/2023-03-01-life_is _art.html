<h2 class="section-heading">Consistent Shelter</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"feeling safe"</blockquote>
<p>
    Creativity is hard for me without first feeling safe. If things like
    finances or relationships are not where I want them to be my ability to
    create slows to a churn if not an outright halt. Without shelter of
    employment, health, friends, family etc, my desire to create is stunted.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Work</h2>

<p>
    I recently began looking for a new job which completely consumed me and any
    free time I had. Multiple rounds of interviews often requiring take-home
    assignments followed by interview panels completely eradicated my attempts
    to indulge in making art.
</p>

<p>
    When things are calm at work, not being too challenging or easy, my
    inclination to create begins to flow, but as soon as work shoots in one way
    or the other my creative output dries up.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Personal</h2>

<p>
    My mother, someone I am not on the best terms with, came to stay recently
    for knee replacement surgery with the expectation she would only stay for a
    couple of weeks. Needless to say her visit unraveled into several weeks
    causing ripples of discontent in my own marriage. Now if my mother and I had
    a relationship to stand on then I think it would have invigorated my
    creative process, but without fond memories to pull me up her presence
    provided zero benefit to me or my family.
</p>

<p>
    The idea of the tortured artist is so foreign to me because during these
    moments the last thing I would want to do would be to create anything,
    rather I choose to consume; media, food, alcohol, marijuana or whatever
    necessary to escape the moment.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Balance</h2>

<p>
    When living my best there seems to be a balance and effortlessness to it
    all; every puzzle piece seems to just fit, inside and outside. Instead of
    relying on moments of ease though, I want to use art as a means to lift
    myself up from the inside when things are down and out on the outside.
