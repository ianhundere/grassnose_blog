    "the tools / limits inform the process"

<p>
    Distractions are everywhere especially when you're not particularly keen to
    create. Being aware of the things that trigger my distractive nature has
    helped remove friction(s) to the process. The one thing that seems to always
    get in the way, at least initially, is the computer. Whether it's a
    notification to check my email, an OS update, or just the uinspiring glare
    of the mouse and keyboard.

<h2 class="section-heading">Less is more</h2>
<p>
    I like to chunk my studio time in achievable goals or sessions whereby I may
    or may not include the computer. I've done a variety of things to remove the
    computer or make its precense less pronounced, but I always come back to it
    especially towards the end of finishing a song to fully flesh it out as a
    whole. It's at the initial phase(s) of building a song that I want to hide
    the computer. Once it's gone, the assortment of choices to pluck dwindles
    greatly and the possibilities become much easier to execute.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hey fly, come back here</h2>
<p>
    Though, when a computer really comes in handy for me is when there's an idea
    ripe for the plucking. A skeleton just waiting to be filled with embellished
    guts of context. It's at this point that the computer becomes indispensible.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Overdoing it</h2>
<p>
    Part of the reasoning behind removing the computer is to set limits as a
    song finds its footing. And even within' those limitations, the
    possibilities are still quite endless. I've gone to further than I'd like to
    admit to set limits; "limitation" cards to set parameters for each track in
    a song. At this point, I feel I've gone too far and making the process far
    too rigid / inflexible.

</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Go fast</h2>
More than anything, I simply want to remove the barriers that prevent me from
moving forward. The longer I work on something, the staler it becomes, and the
harder it becomes to finish it. The rig / config, and any limits imposed, are
what inform the process and the ideas / fruit that grow from of it.
<h2 class="section-heading">tl;dr</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>know your tools intimately</li>
        <li>remove blockers from the get-go</li>
        <li>get started with a plan (or don't :o)</li>
    </ul>
