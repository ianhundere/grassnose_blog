    Identifying distractions in my workflow is something I've always struggled
    with. The one distraction that seems to always, at least initially, block me
    is the presence of a computer. Whether it's a notification to check my email
    (or whatever), an OS update, or just the uinspiring glare of the mouse and
    keyboard as my day job forces me behind a computer for much of the workday.

<h2 class="section-heading">Less is more</h2>
<p>
    I like to chunk my studio time in achievable goals or sessions whereby I may
    or may not include the computer. I've done a variety of things to remove the
    computer, or friction, but I always find it helpful towards the end of
    especially to flesh out the song as a whole. It's at the initial phase(s) of
    building a song that I want to hide the computer. Once it's gone, the
    assortment of choices to pluck dwindles greatly and the possibilities become
    much easier to execute.

<h2 class="section-heading">Hey fly, come back here</h2>
<p>
    Though, when a computer really comes in handy for me is when there's an idea
    ripe for the plucking. A skeleton just waiting to be filled with embellished
    guts of context. It's at this point that the computer becomes indispensible.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Overdoing it</h2>
<p>
    Part of the reasoning behind removing the computer is to set some limits on
    a song finding its footing. And even within' those limitations, the
    possibilities are still quite limitless. I've gone to further lengths to
    limit what I could do when starting a song like creating "limitation" cards
    that essentially set parameters for each track in a song. I have a feeling
    it is at times like these that I have gone too far and made the process far
    too rigid / inflexible.

<h2 class="section-heading">Go fast</h2>
<p>
    Throughout all of this I have discovered that the config / limits imposed
    are what inform the process, and therefore, the ideas / creations that grow
    from them. - remove blockers from the get-go - know your tools intimately -
    get started with a plan (or don't :o)
