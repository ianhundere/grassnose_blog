<h2 class="section-heading">Workflow</h2>
<p>
    This past summer, I spent a lot of time focusing on workflow changes like
    adding a patchbay to free up inputs and make using the variety of external
    inputs on my gear more purposeful, an APC40 to help hide the fact I'm using
    a computer to record (keep me off the keyboard and mouse), binding CCs to
    hardware MIDI, building new templates to support new workflows (with a focus
    on MIDI and not on audio), and other workflow similar changes. I feel as
    though this was a defense mechanism for not wanting to create anything since
    these studio activities were readily attainable and achieveable. As I was
    knocking out these studio todos, I came across a post a friend posted on
    LinkedIn (the only form of social media I dabble in other than Reddit)
    <a
        href="https://estevancarlos.medium.com/its-time-we-document-our-creative-practice-b96efd841ba2/"
        >the importance of documenting the creative process</a
    >
    which really resonated with me and made me want to start making more of an
    intentional effort in documenting my process.

<h2 class="section-heading">Document</h2>

    Through the years, I've kept moleskin notebooks to document my music making
    process (e.g. keep notes, sketch out midi/audio ins/outs, categorize
    workflows etc), some giving bread crumbs of my overall workflow/process at
    the time.

    Hopefully, this blog will be a stronger vehicle in keeping track of the
    things I do, or don't do, than the moleskin examples above helping to build
    a narrative around the things I make, bringing an awareness of what I do and
    why; giving clues on where/how to improve.

    More than anything, I want my process to be enjoyable. Maybe it's cleaning
    the garage, interviewing for a job, or painting, we all have a process;
    whether it's consistent, effective and/or we enjoy it is another question.
