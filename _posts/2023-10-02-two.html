<p>
    it took a bit of time to get my bits configured (e.g. finding/choosing
    samps, configuring mlre et al to work how i wanted it to work etc)
    specifically because it was my first real dig into using the norns as well
    as the mlrevariant of mlr. the biggest hurdle throughout this whole process
    was myself. i kept having to ignore the self-conscious voice telling me to
    start over after a mistake or not to start at all because family was awake.
</p>

<p>
    i eventually recorded a couple of jams sessions, and after coming home from
    a work trip i gave them a listen. i was actually pretty happy with it
    all-in-all especially since i was mulling over whether i wanted to record
    more to capture a more successful set.

<p>
    the samps i used are from over a long period of time / some of the gear used
    has come/gone.

<h2 class="section-heading">thoughts</h2>

went well
<div class="small">
    <ul>
        <li>worked incredibly quickly</li>
        <li>considering the amount of time spent, happy with the results</li>
    </ul>
</div>

went not so well
<div class="small">
    <ul>
        <li>the nagging voice of second-guessing</li>
    </ul>
</div>
