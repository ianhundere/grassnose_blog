<h2 class="section-heading">process</h2>

<p>
    most everything was triggered by the ndlr (e.g. 4 tracks; pad/chord, bass,
    and 2 melodies) except for a few things like drums etc. initial stage was
    just focusing on the ndlr and then using the octatrack to trigger different
    chords on it to avoid having to manually play patterns from it.
</p>

<p>
    i recorded a bunch of random jams and then spliced them together. i
    definitely wanna change this next time around and focus on using song mode
    again via the monomachine/octatrack and then record into bitwig.

went well
<div class="small">
    <ul>
        <li>things moved quickly</li>
        <li>use of bitwig</li>
        <li>discovered triggering ndlr making it much easier to use</li>
        <li>learned about metering standards making changes in how i metered</li>
        <li>recorded vhs tape sample to octatrack</li>
    </ul>
</div>

went not so well
<div class="small">
    <ul>
        <li>many disparate jams w/o a lot of thought</li>
        <li>
            the 4 patterns used were rushed and didn't complement each other
            well
        </li>
        <li>no external fx</li>
        <li>spent little time on mixing</li>
    </ul>
