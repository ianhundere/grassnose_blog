<p>
    we all have achievables; each day, week, month or year comprised of even
    smaller parts that we complete carrying us into the next wave. 🌊
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">buckets</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"what to do"</blockquote>
<p>
    creatively speaking, there are certain buckets you can put your work in.
    musically it might be to learn an instrument, music theory, sound design or
    simply just consuming the music of others. and with that, here are the
    achievables i've conjured up over the years:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>organize patches / samples</li>
    <li>vcr / cassette / field / found sound recording</li>
    <li>learn daw / hw intricacies</li>
    <li>make new patches</li>
    <li>pattern making</li>
    <li>make a song</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">
    even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day

<blockquote class="blockquote">"broke come woke"</blockquote>
<p>
    and so, as a means to get the creative snow ball rollin' i'm going to try
    and bake/create a sonic experience, not every day, but W<sub>ednesday</sub>,
    S<sub>aturday</sub> and S<sub>unday</sub>.
